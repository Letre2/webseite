Thus, the odds are that the way we learn and teach in the future will be fundamentally changed. Our project sets itself the target to think in a future dimension and create a vision of how this future learning and teaching will look like, focussing on the acquisition of foreign languages. The aim of our voice-user interface Ovi, intended for 5th grade upwards, is to include new technologies more firmly in the learning and teaching process. We developed, a concept for a voice-user interface supported by the latest AI technology GPT-3.</p><p><em><strong>&ldquo;In the context of the COVID-19 crisis interest in mobile learning technologies has grown exponentially."</strong></em><br>UNESCO - International Commission on the Futures of Education</p><br><br><div style="padding:56.25% 0 0;position:relative"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/536689208?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100% frameborder=0 allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src=https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js></script><br><br><br><p><strong>Our digital learning assitant Ovi supports students in learning foreign languages.

Birkenbihl</p><hr><br><h2 id=design-process><strong>Design process</strong></h2><p>Our process was highly influenced by the corona pandemic: From the idea to the method of working. The whole design process was executed remotely. Therefore, we were using tools like Miro, Zoom, Figma, Cinema4D and After Effects.
Due to the (corona) lockdown in our region, user testing was impossible. However, we look forward to realizing it further down the line.</p><br><h3 id=design-principles><strong>Design principles</strong></h3><br><ul><li><p><strong>Three &ldquo;F&rdquo; for gamification</strong><br>Friends, Feedback, Fun.

According to trainer Ms. Birkenbihl, the way foreign languages are learned has changed little since the Bible was translated. In her research, she has spent more than thirty years studying brain-based learning and teaching and is clearly opposed to monotonous vocabulary cramming.<br>According to psychologist Jerome Bruner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Functionalist Theory of Language Acquisition&rdquo;, learning a language works most effectively in the form of communication.</p><p><strong>Key findings:</strong><br>In our research, we were talking we were talking to teachers, students, educational scientist as well as the Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Education. Here is a selection of our main findings:</p><ul><li>Students are already using disallowed AI translation software to do their homework.</li><li>Students often times hesitate to speak in the foreign language.</li><li>Students are afraid to make mistakes when speaking in the foreign language. So they rather prefer to say nothing.</li><li>Students spend too much time in front of the screen.<br></li><li>Teachers see potential in new technology to better motivate students.</li><li>Teachers are afraid of change.</li><li>Teachers are afraid to be replaced by computers.</li><li>Teachers do not want to lose control over students.</li><li>&ldquo;Bring your own device&rdquo; is a no-go motto.</li></ul><p><strong>Prototyping:</strong></p><img src=beide.jpg alt="final ovi" width=60%>
