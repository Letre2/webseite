Our sustainability guidebook focuses entirely on environmentally friendly traveling.Twenty travel adventures of varying length show that there are more and especially more eco-friendly ways than traveling by air. The solution is: traveling over land water, like hiking, cycling or sailing. Additional features such as maps of orientation, tips on best camping places, must-haves for plastiv-free traveling or a self-test on the ecological footprint will inspire and help to plan an own trip.

**About me and Pia**  
On this personal project, I was working with with my friend and illustrator Pia Wieland. Her way of illustrating and my  understanding of imperfect beauty perfectly complemented each other. Apart from that, we have several things in common. We both love traveling on the countryway, we were both involved in social movements for climate justice, and last but not least, we share an interest in art and design. On this basis, we created the Mondo Magazine project. We originated a blog, and finally a whole book. The book's initial version represented Pia's diploma project. In the meantime, the revised version has been published by Knesebeck in Munich, in an edition of 5000 copies.
Creating such a comprehensive work made us face many challenges and decisions. As we worked in a team, solutions could only be found by discussion. So, we both learned to compromise and to be patient.
