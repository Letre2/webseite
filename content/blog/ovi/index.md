<!-- ### **Introducing Language learning**  -->

The Corona pandemic forced the world to digitize education from one day to the next. This event could fundamentally change the way we learn and teach in the future. In this project, we set out to create a vision of how the way we learn foreign languages, starting in 5th grade, could change using new technologies. We developed, a concept for a voice-user interface supported by GPT-3.

### **The result of the project is the digital learning assistant "Ovi" which supports students in learning foreign languages. It does not replace the teacher, it merely serves as a useful tool. In addition to free conversation, "Ovi" can also support the active use of the foreign language through playful approaches such as a "vocabulary duel" or an interactive audio play.  Ovi collects data from the interactions that take place, identifies students' weaknesses and strengths, and generates data visualizations that are made available to both teachers and students. Teachers can thus better identify weaknesses and problems and address them individually. For students, the visualization of their own performance leads to the promotion of independent learning.**

## **Design process**  

In short, our process was highly influneced by the Corona pandemic. From the idea to the method of working. The whole process was executet remote. There for we where useing tools like, Miro, Zoom, Figma, Cinema4D and After Effects.  
Unfortunetly cause of the lock-down in our region we weren't able to do some user test, but might do some in the future.  

### **Design Prinzipien**  
<br>


- **3 "F" Gamification** - Friends, Feedback, Fun. Competitive elements arouse the ambition of the students. Through feedback, students learn to assess themselves and their learning behavior. Fun should be in the foreground at all times.  

- **Making mistakes is okay** - Especially in the beginning there is no direct feedback on mistakes. The voice assistant simply repeats incorrect words in a correct manner (mothering method). This keeps students motivated.

- **Avoiding fear** - Students should not be afraid of embarrassing themselves because of mistakes.  

- **Educational equity** - Everyone is provided with the technical equipment. By deliberately excluding supplementary technologies, such as smartphones, distractions are avoided and educational equity and social permeability are ensured.  

- **Independent learning** - Students can view their learning progress in skill trees and thus better assess themselves.  

- **Relieve and strengthen teachers** - Teachers receive updates on learning success and unprecedented insights into the performance data of individual students. This enables them to provide students with more targeted individual and group support.  

- **Safety first** - reduce screen time, no webcam in the children's room.
