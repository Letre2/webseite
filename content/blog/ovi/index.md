<!-- ### **Introducing Language learning**  -->

The Corona pandemic forced the world to digitize education from one day to the next. This event could fundamentally change the way we learn and teach in the future. In this project, we set out to create a vision of how the way we learn foreign languages, starting in 5th grade, could change using new technologies. We developed, a concept for a voice-user interface supported by GPT-3.

### **The result of the project is the digital learning assistant "Ovi" which supports students in learning foreign languages. It does not replace the teacher, it merely serves as a useful tool. In addition to free conversation, "Ovi" can also support the active use of the foreign language through playful approaches such as a "vocabulary duel" or an interactive audio play.  Ovi collects data from the interactions that take place, identifies students' weaknesses and strengths, and generates data visualizations that are made available to both teachers and students. Teachers can thus better identify weaknesses and problems and address them individually. For students, the visualization of their own performance leads to the promotion of independent learning.**
