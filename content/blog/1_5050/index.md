| **Type:** Semester project - Execution time 2 months<br> **Course**: Application Design - Rebecca Schellhorn <br> **Faculty:** HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd <br> **Year:** 2020 <br>| **Niko Mang** - Interaction Design <br>  **Marla Wagner** - Interaction Design <br> **Luzie Funk** - Interaction Design|  

In the goal of the course Application Design was to redesign a smartphone application. We  chose the local taxi app 50/50. According to the a user-centered methods, iterative product development, prototyping and design in the mobile usage context. We understood and defined the user and analyzed his needs depending on the context. By reorganizing the information structure, we optimized user flows and added user-relevant functions. Optimized user flows are created and user-relevant functions are added. In this way, a coherent and function-oriented interaction and visual design was developed. Product hypotheses are validated and iterated by constatn user testing. Finally a new user experience emerged. The goal.

### **About the 50/50 app**  

For more than 16 years, the "fiftyFifty-Taxi" has been driving young adults late at night home safely and for half the price.
The Ostalbkreis district had its first app for the "fiftyFifty-Taxi" developed in April 2015. In the app, people have to register and load a kind of electronic authorization card onto their smartphone. They show this when they get into the cab, activate the app and scan the QR code of the cab order number with their smartphone.
