| **Type:** Semester project - Execution time 2 months<br> **Course**: Application Design - Rebecca Schellhorn <br> **Faculty:** HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd <br> **Year:** 2020 <br>| **<a href="http://nikomang.de/" target="_blank">Niko Mang</a>** - Interaction Design <br>  **Marla Wagner** - Interaction Design <br> **Luzie Funk** - Interaction Design|  

  In the course Application Design the challenge was to redesign a smartphone application. The goal of the course was to apply basic user-centered methods, iterative product development, prototyping and design in the mobile usage context. We chose the local taxi app 50/50-Taxi. According to the user-centered design approach, we understood and defined the user and analyzed his needs depending on the context. By reorganizing the information structure, we optimized user flows and added user-relevant functions. In this way, a coherent and function-oriented interaction and visual design was developed. Furthermore, product hypotheses were validated and iterated by constant user testing. Finally, a new user experience emerged.

### **About the 50/50 app**  

For more than 16 years, the "50/50-Taxi" has been driving young adults home safely late at night and for half the price.
The first 50/50-Taxi app of the Ostalbkreis district was developed in April 2015. In the app, people need to register and and install an electronic authorization card on their smartphone.
. When they get into the taxi, they show the card, activate the app and scan the QR code of the taxi's order number with their smartphone.
